# LessonFlow 🎓📚

Alongside my coding journey, I am also pursuing a BSc BEd degree. Part of my BEd program involves creating detailed lesson plans as class assignments, which need to follow specific formats like structured tables, mind maps, and extensive text content. This process is too boring specially the writing in word file part, also i dont have the ms word version so I streamline this task, I created LessonFlow—a tool that leverages the Gemini API to automate lesson plan creation with just a few inputs. With the help of the Officegen npm package, the generated content is converted into a `.docx` format that aligns with my course requirements.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Frontend**: Built with React, Recoil for state management, and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB for data storage, Officegen for `.docx` file generation, Zod for validation, and Axios for API requests.
- **AI Integration**: Uses the Google Gemini API for generating relevant lesson content.

## Features ✨

- **Made for me and my classmates**:

##  Acknowledgements 🤝
This project is based on knowledge acquired up to Week 12 in Harkirat Singh’s cohort.

## Future Improvements 🚀

- **UI Enhancements**: I will improve the UI .
- **Backend Optimization**: I will improve the backend also .
- **Lesson Plan Customization**: The teacher specifix lesson plan structure will be added soon.

With each improvement, LessonFlow will be more user-friendly, flexible, and efficient, aiming to further reduce the time and effort involved in creating lesson plans.
