        Creating a lesson plan in Word is too boring , especially when it comes to formatting boxes and aligning everything properly. It's one of the most frustrating tasks to do on a laptop, so I decided to make it easier. Now, you can create a lesson plan quickly and then refine it as you like!

        As a B.Ed. trainee and aspiring developer, I saw the challenges teachers face in creating lesson plans. Traditional methods are often tedious and time-consuming. <br />

        LessonFlow changes that. Powered by the Gemini API, it generates structured lesson plans in seconds, letting teachers focus more on teaching.
